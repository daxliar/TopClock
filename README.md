TopClock
========

![alt tag](http://i66.tinypic.com/2211lu.jpg)

An awful timer made quickly in C# and Windows Forms.
On right click it becomes a simple label floating over every window. 
It hides Windows' clock on start. 
You can customize how often update the time, good for studying e stay focused.

TODO
====

Make it less awful and port on other platforms.
