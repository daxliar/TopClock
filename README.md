TopClock
========

![alt tag](http://i66.tinypic.com/2211lu.jpg)

An awful timer made quickly in C# and Windows Forms to use as countdown.
When you right-click on the timer change it in a floating clock on top of every windows.
It hides Windows' clock on start.
You can set how often refresh the time.

TODO
====

Make it less awful and port on other platforms.
